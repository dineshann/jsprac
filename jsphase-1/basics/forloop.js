/** JavaScript for loop **/
/*
    In JavaScript, a for loop is a control flow statement used to
    repeatedly execute a block of code based on a specified condition.
    The general syntax of a for loop in JavaScript is as follows:
        ! Start      ! Condition   ! ++/+1
    for (initialization: condition; iteration) {
        ! Code to be executed in each iteration
    }
*/ 

console.log("John")

let name = "Dinesh"
for(c=1;c<=10;c=c+2) {
    console.log(name)
}

for (count=1;count<=5;count=count+1) {
    console.log(count)
}

for (i=1;i<=5;i=i+1) {
    console.log(i) 
}

for (a=1;a<=5;a=a+2) {
    console.log(a+"A") 
}

for (n=5;n>=0;n=n-1){
    console.log(n)
}

for (b=1;b<=10;b=b+2){
    console.log(b)
}

for (tb=1;tb<=5;tb=tb+1) {
    console.log("2x"+tb+"="+(tb*2)) 
}
